# BGMI Leaderboard

I created this leaderboard because I couldn't find an existing one that met my requirements. It was developed while conducting a BGMI tournament at Comp-EX, managing a footfall of around 400 players.

This was also my first project in **Next.js**. Since I wasn't able to build the backend, I manually updated the scores. Iâ€™d love for other developers to contribute and help improve it!

## Features
- Real-time leaderboard updates (currently manual)
- Player and team performance tracking
- Custom ranking criteria
- User-friendly interface

## Contributions Welcome!  
I couldnâ€™t build the backend, so Iâ€™m looking for contributors who can help improve the system. If you're interested, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bgmi-leaderboard.git
cd bgmi-leaderboard
npm install
npm start
```

## Background
This project was inspired by my experience at Comp-EX, where I needed an efficient way to manage and display rankings for a large-scale BGMI tournament.

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make improvements (especially the backend!).
3. Submit a pull request.

Let's build something awesome together! ðŸš€
